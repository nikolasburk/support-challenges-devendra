# Developer Success Engineer - Challenges

### Getting started

Clone this repository and start working on the challenges. Each challenge contains its own README with instructions for setting up the challenge (if necessary) and a problem description.

### Deliverables

For each challenge, please include:

- a friendly response to the user who ran into the problem (written in Markdown)
- a description of your personal thought process for how you approached the problem (except challenges 2 and 6)
- a fix or workaround to resolve the issue (if possible)

Please submit your solutions via another GitHub repository on your own account. Feel free to ping `@nikolasburk` on the [Prisma Slack](http://slack.prisma.io/) if you're running into any problems.

If you're unfamiliar with the basics of the Prisma Framework, we recommend running through the [Prisma Framework tutorial](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) first.

The time estimate for this task is **1 day** and you will be paid with a rate of **250 Euros** per day. You can spread the work across multiple days if you prefer. Please coordinate the payment with [Josh](mailto:mcleod@prisma.io).
