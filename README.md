# Developer Success Engineer - Challenges

Clone this repository and start working on the challenges. Each challenge contains its own README with instructions how to setup the challenge (if necessary) and a problem description.

For each challenge, please include:

- a friendly response to the user who ran into the problem (written in Markdown)
- a description of your personal thought process for how you approached the problem
- a fix or workaround to resolve the issue (if possible)

Note that you don't need to include the description of your personal thought process for challenges 5 and 6.

If you're unfamiliar with the basics of the Prisma Framework, we recommend running through the [Prisma Framework tutorial](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) first.

Please submit your solutions via another GitHub repository on your own account.
