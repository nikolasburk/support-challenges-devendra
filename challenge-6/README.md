# Challenge 6

## Context

Prisma is dedicated to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. In order to achieve this we have a couple of tools in place. 

- Prisma Code of Conduct: [https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- A focus on inclusivity and close moderation of all channels to avoid strong language or unwelcome speech

We feel this is key to Prisma's success and want to consistently find ways to make sure our community remains a welcoming and friendly environment even as it grows.

In this challenge, you'll be playing our community moderator and write a response for each statement below, asking the person to amend (not delete) their text. Provide a friendly explanation for each as to why the person should use different language, providing links to resources or similar if appropriate. 

Your answer should contain:

- Your message to the original poster
- Where you would contact them (for example DM, threaded slack response, etc)
- Why you chose that place to contact them

## Problem: Strong language

Imagine you find this comment in a GitHub issue from a community member that you have previously talked to on the Prisma Slack:

> TypeORM and Sequelize both suck compared to Photon.js. I love how fucking easy Photon makes it to talk to a database and making sure all database queries are completely type safe!

## Problem: Non-inclusive language

Imagine that someone reached out in the Prisma Slack `#general` channel with a technical question and prefaced their question with a `Hi guys! ðŸ‘‹`. What would you write to them about this?
