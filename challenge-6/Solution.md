### Problem: Strong language

#### Message to the original poster:
    - Hey @username, First of all, We would like to thank you very much for taking the time to share your views on how useful Prisma is for you. We appreciate your enthusiasm, but at the same time as our mission to create and maintain an inclusive, welcoming community we appreciate it more when members refrain from using the strong language in their posts/comments. Can you please edit the post to avoid such strong language :) Also, please join us in making this community welcoming to all. So, let us all grow by following the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


##### Where you would contact them (for example DM, threaded slack response, etc):
	- Slack DM
##### Why you chose that place to contact them:
	- Provided the user expressed strong language we can make them aware of the community nature and code of conduct discretely and in a friendly manner.





### Problem: Non-inclusive language

Note: @me here refers to the responder.

#### Message to the original poster:
  - Hey @username, this is @me. I have a small request/suggestion about a small yet important matter. Even though the use of the word "Guys", doesn't sound wrong due to its widespread use while addressing a mix-gender group of individuals, the word actually is gendered. Still, when we pay attention to such detail and refrain ourselves from using such a common term, we make the environment we work in more inclusive. As part of our community standards and values, we believe in fairness and equality. So please join us in this mission :)

	- Provided the user has used non-inclusive language we can make them aware of the same and educate on the matter in a friendly manner. Such matters are always good to be dealt with professionally and discretely
