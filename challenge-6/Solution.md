### Problem: Non-inclusive language

#### Message to the original poster:
  - Hey @username, 

	- Even though it doesnt sound offensive due to its widespread use while addressing group of people, the word actualy is gendered.
	- Still when we pay attention to such a detail and refrain ourselves from using such a common term to make the envrionment we work in more inclusive, we start to value other improtant values as we need for a strong and welcoming community.
