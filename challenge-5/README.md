## Problem description

Hello! I am starting a new project where I want to build a REST API that's connected to a MySQL database. I have looked into different ways of talking to a database in Node.js and found three main options:

- knex.js
- Sequelize
- Photon.js

I'm not a SQL expert so I'd like to avoid working too low level. Any idea which of these options might be the most appropriate for me and why?
